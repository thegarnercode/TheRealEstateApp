index.js Notes

m = margin

we created a text called purpose , in the banner component
that we can use later on , 
purpose will be used through props  
every functional component has props
this way we will be able to reuse the text

Box is the most abstract component 
on top of which other Chakra components 
are built. 
it renders a div element by default.
(Box is like div in Chakra)
